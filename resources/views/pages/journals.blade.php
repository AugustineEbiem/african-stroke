                                                <p>Africa is the world’s most genetically diverse, second largest, and second most populous continent, with over one billion
                                                people distributed across 54 countries. <br>With a 23% lifetime risk of stroke, Africa has some of the highest rates of stroke
                                                worldwide and many occur in the prime of life with huge economic losses and grave implications for the individual, family,
                                                and the society in terms of mental capital, productivity, and socioeconomic progress. <br>Tackling the escalating burden of
                                                stroke in Africa requires prioritized, multipronged, and inter-sectoral strategies tailored to the unique African epidemiological,
                                                cultural, socioeconomic, and lifestyle landscape.</p>
                                                <p>The African Stroke Organization (ASO) is a new pan-African coalition that brings together stroke researchers, clinicians, and other health-care professionals with participation of
                                                national and regional stroke societies and stroke support organizations. With a vision to reduce the rapidly increasing burden of stroke in Africa, the ASO has a four-pronged focus on ;

                                                <p>This will be delivered through advocacy, awareness, and empowerment initiatives to bring about people-focused changes in policy, clinical practice, and public education. In the
                                                spirit of the African philosophy of Ubuntu - ‘‘I am because we are,’’; the ASO will harness the power of diversity, inclusiveness, togetherness, and team work to build a strong, enduring, and impactful platform for tackling stroke in Africa.</p>

                                                    Africa is currently experiencing an epidemiologic transition and double burden of disease driven by population aging, changes in dietary habits, physical
                                                    inactivity, and increased vascular risk factors (especially

                                                    while infectious diseases persist. Persons living with

                                                    risk factors further complicate the picture

                                                    death, and dementia worldwide.1 Africa, in particular,
                                                    has some of the highest rates of stroke worldwide, with
                                                    an annual stroke incidence rate up to 316 per 100,000, a
                                                    prevalence rate up to 1460 per 100,000, and three-year
                                                    fatality rate up to 84%.2–5 Data to estimate the lifetime
                                                    risk of stroke among Africans are limited but it is likely
                                                    to be higher than the 23% suggested in a recent analysis
                                                    of the Global Burden of Disease Study (global average:

                                                    across Africa and many people affected by stroke live
                                                    in hard to reach communities. Stroke leads to both tangible
                                                    and intangible economic losses and many Africans
                                                    are struck in the prime of life, during their productive

                                                    Stroke research productivity is low in Africa.

                                                    are also sorely lacking.8 Tackling the burden of stroke

It is now absolutely necessary and crucial to evolve a multilevel, multipronged, and multistrategic approach to engage with relevant cultural, economic, political, and professional blocks in Africa and beyond and get stroke prioritized on the development agenda for Africa. We need to also create awareness among key stakeholders including the private and public sectors. Thus, we need a platform that will facilitate engagement with the African Union (AU), the World Bank, New Partnership for Africa’s Development, and the World Health Organization (WHO) for a more proactive and more effective focus on stroke in Africa. The time is now, if Africa will be saved from the devastating individual, family, and societal impact of stroke and progress will be made towards the actualization of the Sustainable Development Goal 3 which is aimed to ‘‘ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing . . . ’’ and reduce premature death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including stroke by 33% by year 2030.</p>

                                                <p>There have been previous pockets of efforts in the last two decades to create regional stroke platforms in Africa. In 2004, the Franco-African League against Stroke was established among francophone African countries and has since run regular programs of advocacy and stroke education including an annual stroke meeting. In September 2010, participants at the first East African Neuroscience Conference in Nairobi, Kenya also discussed the need and possibility of creating an African Stroke Society. The origin of the African Stroke Organization (ASO), the first pan-African stroke initiative, dates back to 5 October 2016 when the concept document for its establishment was first developed and forwarded to the leadership of the World Stroke Organization (WSO) and other leaders in the stroke community. The idea was extremely well received and supported. Together with other leaders, efforts have subsequently been made to secure funding support to convene a strategic leaders’ synergium 15 and the first African stroke conference16 in a bid to bring together diverse individuals and groups for real engagement that will change the stroke narrative in Africa. The ASO aspires to be an effective and true pan- African society of stroke researchers, clinicians, other health-care professionals, and stroke survivors with support from national and regional stroke societies and SSOs with passion for, and commitment to, stroke care, research, education, and advocacy. The primary goal is to reduce the escalating burden of stroke and its short- and long-term consequences on the people of Africa. The ASO will further anchor activities of the global Stroke Control Observatory and burden Reduction Ecosystem for Africa as part of the WSO-Lancet Neurology Commission on stroke in low- and middle-income countries.17 The concept of the vision, mission, and core programs is set out in Figure 1. However, further consultation on these elements will be sought in the operational planning stage from a wider range of stakeholders from across Africa and involving disciplines related to cerebrovascular diseases.</p>
